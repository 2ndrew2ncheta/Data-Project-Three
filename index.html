<p>
On March 31, 2021,  New York State enacted the Marijuana Regulation and Taxation Act, fully legalizing the recreational use of cannabis. The plant had been decriminalized for medical use in 2016, and decriminalized for recreational purposes in 2019. </p>

<p>Following legalization, the number of drug-related complaints to the city's 311 hotline more than doubled. Not all of those calls relate to cannabis, but the increase corresponds with a sharp increase in ad-hoc dispensaries. “The black market isn’t struggling to meet demand,” wrote the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-progressive-paradox-on-marijuana-new-york-weed-kathy-hochul-john-hickenlooper-11669072860"><i>Wall Street Journal</i></a>, “as every nose in Manhattan can attest.” </p>

<p> However, not all areas are equally affected: some neighborhoods reported only a handful of complaints, while others saw hundreds of complaints to a single address.</p>

<iframe title="Drug Activity Complaints by Area" aria-label="Map" id="datawrapper-chart-irFxH" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/irFxH/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="778" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();</script>

<p>At first glance, the most drug activity appeared to occur in Queens community board 8. One address in particular stood out: the Queens Hospital Center, at 82-68 164th Street, was the site of over 1,400 drug-related complaints in 2022. If the sidewalk outside that hospital were its own community board, it would still have more drug complaints than any other district.</p>

<p> “We call it the robo-caller,” said Deputy Investigator Kevin Chan of the 107th precinct. “This person or this program is constantly sending us calls.”</p>

<p>In addition to the hospital, Chan identified two nearby locations—the fire department and the police precinct—that were also targets of 311 spam. These three addresses together account for over a third of the city's drug complaints.</p>

<p>“I gotta assume it's a program,” Chan added. “I can't imagine someone just sitting there hitting send every single minute.”</p>

<p>Chan also confirmed that cannabis constituted the majority of drug-related complaints. “I would say probably 90% of drug calls are weed calls,” he said in a telephone interview. “Everyone knows what weed is. You don’t smell the other stuff.”</p>

<p> Omitting those outliers leaves Manhattan's 11th community board as the place with the most drug complaints. This district, corresponding with East Harlem and Randall's Island, fielded 593 drug activity calls, spread out among many addresses within the area.</p>
